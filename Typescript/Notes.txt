javascript:
    Dynamic Type
Typescript:
    Superset of javascript
    Static Type ( declare data types) 
    advanced future like tuple, interface and generic etc
complier:
    Browser can only understand javascript
    Typescript needs to be compiled to javascript
Arrays:
    Implicit: No need to mention Typescript
    ex:
    let numArray = [1,2,3]
    let strArray = ['a','b','c']
    let boolArray = [true, false]

    Explicit : Need to mention types
    let numArray : number[] = [1,2,3]
    let strArray : string[] = ['a','b','c']
    let boolArray : boolean[] =[true, false]

    Declare:
    Once we ready to declare array we should initially in the starting. 
    then only we may avoid compile time erros.

    Readonly array:
    We cannot change anything when we use readonly array.
